# Schedule your practice session #
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.
- Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
- When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
- Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”
